A Simple Web Browser Written in Java
====================================
I wanted to code up a simple web browser perhaps to better understand how a browser
makes http requests and renders pages to the browser. Naturally, Most would say C++
would be the best choice for creating a browser; however, since I was more familiar
with Java at the time, I decided to start with Java. 
I will add more comments and features down
the road.
